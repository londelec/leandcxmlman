AUTOCfg group and AUTO node
---------------------------

Group node :ref:`AUTOCfg<ref-IEC10xslAUTOCfg>` and element nodes :ref:`AUTO<ref-IEC10xslAUTO>` enable automatic object linking without a need to create 
DI/AI/DO/AO object table.
All DI/AI/DO/AO objects of the Master protocol instance are automatically linked to Slave protocol instance if this feature is used.
Easiest way to enable automatic linking is by specifying value of the :ref:`<ref-IEC101maIndex>` attribute of any Master protocol instance in the :ref:`<ref-IEC10xslAUTOSource>` attribute. 
By default information addresses of DI/AI/DO/AO objects will be the same as defined in Master protocol instance's object table.
It is also possible to override automatic information address initialization and have them initialized sequentially using :ref:`<ref-IEC10xslAUTODIInfAddr>`; :ref:`<ref-IEC10xslAUTOAIInfAddr>`; :ref:`<ref-IEC10xslAUTODOInfAddr>`; :ref:`<ref-IEC10xslAUTOAOInfAddr>` attributes.
The first object will have information address as specified and following objects will be initialized sequentially.
:ref:`AUTOCfg<ref-IEC10xslAUTOCfg>` group can have multiple :ref:`AUTO<ref-IEC10xslAUTO>` nodes as shown in the sample below.

.. code-block:: none

   <AutoCfg> 
 	<AUTO Source="1"  Name="RTU1" />
	<AUTO Source="2"  Name="RTU2" />
	<AUTO Name="RTU3" />
   </AutoCfg>

   <AUTO Source="1" DIInfAddr="1001" AIInfAddr="2001" DOInfAddr="4001" AOInfAddr="5001" DIqual="0x00" AIqual="0x00" DOqual="0x00" AOqual="0x00" DIGroupMask="0x0001" AIGroupMask="0x0002" Policy="0" CommsOnlineAddr="1" Name="Auto configuration" />

.. tip:: Attributes of the :ref:`AUTO<ref-IEC10xslAUTO>` element node can be arranged in any order, it will not affect the XML file validation.
