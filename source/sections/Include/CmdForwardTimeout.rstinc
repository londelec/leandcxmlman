     :desc:	Command forward timeout is a maximal delay in seconds for how long communication protocol instance awaits destination (Master protocol instance) to become available for accepting a new command.
		If destination protocol instance is in the process of executing previous command, it may not be able to accept new command before the previous command is complete.
		The new command fails within a configured number of seconds if it can't be forwarded to the destination.
		This timeout allows control command queueing for a short period of time and ensures pending command is automatically purged if destination protocol instance is unable to accept the new command.
		Value 0 disables command queueing and command fails instantly if the destination protocol instance is unable to accept the new command.
