     :desc:	Continuously generate control commands to a PLC command with index specified in the :ref:`xmlattr-plcPNTCmdIndex` attribute for as long as PLC point position remains :include-arg:`1`.
		Outgoing control commands will have a qualifier ON.
		A new PLC command will be generated every 1sec.
		Command generation stops when PLC point position is no longer :include-arg:`1` or any of the quality bits [:lemonobgtext:`IV NT BL NT`] are set.
		Please note, the command queue is purged instantly when outstation goes offline.
		This means no previous commands will be sent when outstation goes online again.
