     :desc:	Send control command to DO index specified in :ref:`xmlattr-plcPNTDstIndex` of the communication protocol instance :ref:`xmlattr-plcPNTDstDevice`
		every time the PLC point position transitions from :include-arg:`1` and none the quality bits [:lemonobgtext:`IV NT BL NT`] are set.
		Outgoing control command will have a qualifier ON.
		A command will be generated for every PLC point transition, which means multiple commands will be sent if the point changes position more than once even in a short period of time.
		Commands are placed in the queue and sent to the destination protocol instance one by one.
		This ensures receiving outstation has enough time to complete a command, before the next one is sent.
		Please note, the command queue is purged instantly when outstation goes offline.
		This means no previous commands will be sent when outstation goes online again.
