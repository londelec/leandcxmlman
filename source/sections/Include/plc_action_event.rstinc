     :desc:	Generate control command to a PLC command with index specified in the :ref:`xmlattr-plcPNTCmdIndex` attribute every time the PLC point position transitions from :include-arg:`1` and none of the quality bits [:lemonobgtext:`IV NT BL NT`] are set.
		Outgoing control command will have a qualifier ON.
		A command will be generated for every PLC point transition, which means multiple commands may be sent if the point changes position more than once in a short period of time
		:include-arg:`2`
		Commands are placed in the queue and forwarded to the PLC command one by one.
		This ensures receiving outstation(s) have enough time to complete a previous command, before the next one is sent.
		Please note, the command queue is purged instantly when outstation goes offline.
		This means no previous commands will be sent when outstation goes online again.
