     :desc:	:include-arg:`2` (inclusive) analog value that will result in scaling.
		The resulting value of a PLC point :ref:`xmlelem-plcPNT` or PLC command :ref:`xmlelem-plcCMD` will have :ref:`xmlattr-plcScalingOffset` added and multiplied by the :ref:`xmlattr-plcScalingCoeff`
		whenever the source AI/AO value falls within a range set by :ref:`xmlattr-plcScalingMin` and :ref:`xmlattr-plcScalingMax` attributes.
		Positive and negative infinity values 'inf' and '-inf' can be specified.
		Note, received AI/AO values are compared to this attribute after scaling in the originating protocol instance is applied
		(e.g. coefficient in source Master instance in case of an AI and Slave instance in case of an AO)
