Group node :include-arg:`1` and element nodes :include-arg:`2` are used to define :include-arg:`4` information objects that allow to receive a :include-arg:`5` command from upstream Master station.
Each :include-arg:`2` node must have a destination to forward the :include-arg:`5` command to.
The destination is created by linking :include-arg:`2` node to a :include-arg:`4` information object of any Master protocol instance.
(Master protocol instances are defined in :ref:`xmlgroup-CommunicationCfg` group in |leandcxml| file)
